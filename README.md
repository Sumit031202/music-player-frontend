## 🎵 Music Player Website

**🔗 Live Demo:** [https://music-player-sumit.vercel.app](https://music-player-sumit.vercel.app)

This is a responsive and interactive music player web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It’s currently in the development phase, so a few features may not work as expected. I’m actively working on improvements and new functionality to make the experience smoother and more complete.
